# JS-Dynamic-type-validation

Data type validation in function calls on **Runtime** to be used in ES6.

## Objective:
Every JS programmer knows how cumbersome it is to work with static validators of data types. That's why I created this library, to help us and make sure that our function is always executed only with the types of data that we define for it.
