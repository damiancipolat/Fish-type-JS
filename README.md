# JS-Dynamic-type-validation

Data type validation in function calls on **Runtime** to be used in ES6.

## Objective:
Every JS programmer knows how annoying it is to work with static validators of data types. That's why I created this library, to help us and make sure that our function is always executed only with the types of data that we define for it.

## Type data validation:
This library uses joi to handle the type validations, you can use custom primitives data as "string", "bool", "number" to validate if the parameters used to call a function match with the paramters that we define to allow it.

## Usage:

#### Install:

Run this command to install the library from npm.
```sh
npm install dyn-check
```
